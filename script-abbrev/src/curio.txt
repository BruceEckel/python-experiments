Will you go hunt, my lord?

The hart.

If the Duke continue these favors towards you, Cesario, you are like to be much advanced. He hath known you but three days, and already you are no stranger. 

No, believe me. 

He is not here, so please your Lordship, that should sing it.

Feste the jester, my lord, a Fool that the Lady Olivia's father took much delight in. He is about the house.

A contract of eternal bond of love,
Confirmed by mutual joinder of your hands,
Attested by the holy close of lips, 
Strengthened by interchangement of your rings,
And all the ceremony of this compact
Sealed in my function, by my testimony;
Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave
I have traveled but two hours.
